# Frontend Architecture

Repo: `taskmanager-web` (separate from the `TaskManager` backend repo).
Verified against source on 2026-09-19 (through commit `7df89c2`). Source code is the ultimate truth — if this
document disagrees with the code, the code wins.

## Overview

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 (`src/app/globals.css`), shadcn/ui (`style: base-nova`, base color `neutral`) |
| UI primitives | `@base-ui/react` (not Radix) via shadcn components |
| Server state | TanStack React Query v5 |
| Client state | Zustand v5 (`persist`, `skipHydration`) |
| HTTP | Axios, single shared instance |
| Icons / toasts | lucide-react / sonner |
| Theming | `next-themes` (`ThemeProvider`, class strategy, header toggle) |
| Animation | `@rive-app/react-canvas` via `RivePlayer` — scaffolded only; no `.riv` files and no live usage yet |
| Tests | Playwright end-to-end only (`e2e/`, `npm run test:e2e`), run locally against the real backend. No unit tests. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `npm run lint` + `npm run build` only — see Testing |
| Git hooks | Husky `pre-commit` → `lint-staged` → `eslint --fix` on staged `*.ts`/`*.tsx` |

The app is a storefront over the backend microservices, reached through the API gateway.
Every page that touches data is a Client Component (`"use client"`); there is no server-side
data fetching, no Server Action, and no middleware.

## Application Structure

```text
src/
  app/          App Router routes (all pages, one root layout)
  components/
    layout/     SiteHeader, SiteFooter, CartDrawer
    ui/         shadcn/ui primitives
  features/     Feature slices: auth, catalog, inventory, orders
                  <feature>/api.ts        Axios calls + DTO types
                  <feature>/use-*.ts      React Query hooks
                  <feature>/*.tsx         feature-specific components
  lib/          api-client, api-error, jwt, utils
  providers/    QueryProvider, StoreHydrator
  store/        Zustand stores (auth, cart)
```

**Convention:** each feature owns `api.ts` (transport + types) and a `use-*.ts` hook module
(React Query). Components never call `apiClient` directly — they call feature hooks.

## Routing

App Router, no route groups, no nested layouts. `src/app/layout.tsx` is the only layout and
mounts `ThemeProvider → QueryProvider → StoreHydrator + SiteHeader + main + SiteFooter +
CartDrawer + Toaster`. `<html>` carries `suppressHydrationWarning` because `next-themes` sets
the theme class before hydration.

| Route | Access | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | public | Static hero + category grid with illustrations (server component). The hero's stats ("4 Categories", "Free Returns", "24/7 Support") and the "Free shipping over $50" badge are hardcoded copy, not backed by any data or backend feature |
| `/products` | public | Filters/sort/pagination driven by URL search params |
| `/products/[id]` | public | Product detail + stock, add-to-cart |
| `/login`, `/register` | public | `/login?redirect=<path>` is honored |
| `/account` | auth | Profile, sign out, admin link if Admin |
| `/orders`, `/orders/[id]` | auth | Both guarded. The detail page redirects to bare `/login` (no `?redirect=`), so after signing in the user lands on `/account`, not back on the order |
| `/checkout` | auth | |
| `/admin/products` | auth + Admin | |

Pages that read `useSearchParams` (`/products`, `/login`) wrap their content in `<Suspense>`
— required for the App Router prerender.

Dynamic route params are typed with the Next-generated `PageProps<"/route">` /
`LayoutProps<"/">` globals and unwrapped with React `use(props.params)`.

## Authentication

Flow (all client-side):

```text
LoginPage → useLogin() → POST /users/login → { token, expiresAtUtc }
  → authStore.setSession(token, expiresAtUtc)   (persisted to localStorage "tm-auth")
  → invalidate ["currentUser"] → router.push(redirect ?? "/account")
```

- **Token storage:** `localStorage` key `tm-auth`, via Zustand `persist` (`partialize` keeps
  only `token` + `expiresAtUtc`).
- **Attachment:** an Axios request interceptor reads `useAuthStore.getState().token` and sets
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request (no allowlist — the header is sent to all
  endpoints, including public ones).
- **Expiry:** `isAuthenticated()` compares `expiresAtUtc` to `Date.now()`. There is no timer;
  expiry is only noticed on the next render or the next 401.
- **401 handling:** a response interceptor calls `authStore.logout()`, clears the entire React
  Query cache (`queryClient.clear()`), and re-rejects. It does **not** redirect; the user is
  bounced to `/login` only if they are on a `useRequireAuth` page (its effect fires on the
  state change).
- **Logout:** `useLogout()` clears the auth store and the entire React Query cache. There is no
  server-side logout/revocation call.
- **Refresh persistence:** `persist` uses `skipHydration: true`; `StoreHydrator` (mounted in
  the root layout) rehydrates both stores in an effect and then sets `hasHydrated`. Guards wait
  on `hasHydrated` so a hard reload does not bounce a signed-in user to `/login`.
- **Current user:** `useCurrentUser()` decodes `sub` from the JWT and queries `GET /users/{id}`,
  enabled only when authenticated.

## Authorization / Roles

- Role is read **client-side from the JWT** by `src/lib/jwt.ts`, from the claim
  `http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role`. `isAdmin()` is true when that
  claim equals `"Admin"` and the session is unexpired. The token is decoded with `atob` — the
  signature is never verified in the browser.
- `useRequireAuth(redirectTo, { requireAdmin, forbiddenRedirectTo })` is the single guard hook.
  It returns `{ isReady }`; pages render `null` until ready. Non-admins on `/admin/products`
  are redirected to `/`.
- **This is UI convenience, not a security boundary.** Nothing stops a client from rendering
  admin UI or issuing admin requests; enforcement is the backend's (`Admin` policy on the
  catalog/inventory write endpoints — see the backend `docs/authentication.md`).

## API Client

`src/lib/api-client.ts` exports a single Axios instance.

| Concern | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Base URL | `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL ?? "http://localhost:8000"` (the API gateway) |
| Auth header | Request interceptor, Bearer from the auth store |
| 401 | Response interceptor → `logout()`, error re-thrown |
| Other statuses | Not intercepted; handled per-call by React Query |
| Error messages | `getApiErrorMessage(error, fallback)` reads ProblemDetails `detail` then `title` |

All calls are centralized in `features/*/api.ts`. Backend paths used, matching the gateway
route prefixes: `/users`, `/products`, `/inventory`, `/orders`. (`/tasks` and `/basket` exist on
the gateway but the frontend calls neither.)

`getInventory` is the one place that swallows a status: 404 → `null` (product with no
inventory record).

## React Query

- One `QueryClient`, a module-level singleton in `src/lib/query-client.ts`, handed to
  `QueryProvider`. It is a singleton (rather than created in component state) so the Axios 401
  interceptor can clear it outside React. That is only safe because nothing fetches on the
  server — adding SSR data fetching would make this client shared across requests.
- Defaults: `staleTime: 60_000`, `retry: 1`. No persistence, no devtools, no SSR hydration.

| Key | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `["products", params]` | `useProducts` | `placeholderData: keepPrevious` for filter/page changes |
| `["product", id]` | `useProduct` | `enabled: Boolean(id)` |
| `["inventory"]` | `useInventoryList` | admin list |
| `["inventory", productId]` | `useInventory` | |
| `["orders"]` | `useOrders` | |
| `["order", id]` | `useOrder` | **polls every 1500 ms while status is `Pending`**, then stops — this is how the async fulfillment saga's result reaches the UI |
| `["currentUser", userId]` | `useCurrentUser` | |

Mutations invalidate rather than optimistically update: create product → `["products"]`;
create/restock inventory → `["inventory"]` and `["inventory", productId]`; create order →
`["orders"]`. No optimistic updates anywhere.

Note the key overlap: `["inventory"]` is both the list key and a prefix of `["inventory", id]`,
so invalidating the list also invalidates every per-product query. Intentional or not, that is
the current behavior.

## Zustand

| Store | Persisted (`localStorage`) | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `auth-store` (`tm-auth`) | `token`, `expiresAtUtc` | Session token, expiry check, `isAdmin()` derived from the JWT, `hasHydrated` flag |
| `cart-store` (`tm-cart`) | `items` | Cart lines (`productId`, `name`, `price`, `quantity`), drawer `isOpen` (not persisted) |

Both use `skipHydration: true` and are rehydrated by `StoreHydrator`.

`useCartCount()` / `useCartSubtotal()` are selector hooks exported alongside the cart store —
the pattern for derived cart values.

**The cart is purely client-side.** The backend `BasketService` is never called; cart contents
exist only in the browser and are sent to `POST /orders` at checkout, including the client's
own `unitPrice`.

## Product / Catalog

```text
/products page (URL search params = filter state)
  → useProducts({category,minPrice,maxPrice,search,sort,page,pageSize:12})
  → GET /products?…  → { items, totalCount, page, pageSize }
  → grid of ProductCard | skeletons | "No products match your filters."
```

- Filter state lives in the URL, not in a store; `updateParams` rewrites the query string with
  `router.push` and resets `page` unless `page` is the field being changed.
- Sort options: `newest | price-asc | price-desc | name`. Price slider range is `0–200`
  (`MAX_PRICE`); values at the bounds are omitted from the request.
- Categories are a hardcoded frontend constant (`src/features/catalog/categories.ts`), not
  fetched from the backend.
- Detail page combines `useProduct(id)` and `useInventory(id)`; add-to-cart is disabled while
  inventory loads or when `quantityAvailable === 0`.
- Checkout: `POST /orders` with the cart lines → clear cart → `router.push(/orders/{id})`,
  where the polling `useOrder` shows `Pending → Confirmed | Cancelled` and renders
  `cancellationReason` on cancellation.

## Admin Panel

- No admin layout or nav; a single page `/admin/products`, linked from `/account` only when
  `isAdmin()`.
- Guarded by `useRequireAuth("/login?redirect=/admin/products", { requireAdmin: true })`.
- Lists `useProducts({ pageSize: 100 })` joined against `useInventoryList()` via a
  `Map<productId, quantityAvailable>`.
- **New product** is a two-step client-orchestrated flow: `POST /products`, then on success
  `POST /inventory` with the initial stock. If the second call fails, the product exists with
  no inventory record — there is no rollback.
- **Restock** calls `POST /inventory/{id}/restock`; on a 404 it falls back to `POST /inventory`
  (creating the record), which is how products created without stock are handled.

## UI Architecture

- shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui`, built on `@base-ui/react`. Base UI's composition
  prop is `render` (not Radix `asChild`): `<Button nativeButton={false} render={<Link …/>} />`,
  `<DialogTrigger render={<Button…/>} />`. Follow this when adding components.
- Variants via `class-variance-authority`; `cn` is re-exported from the `cn` package through
  `src/lib/utils.ts` (not the usual local `clsx + tailwind-merge` helper).
- Icons: `lucide-react`. Toasts: `sonner`, mounted once as `<Toaster />` in the root layout.
- Theming: `ThemeProvider` (`attribute="class"`, `defaultTheme="system"`) in the root layout; a
  `ThemeToggle` in `SiteHeader` flips light/dark; `sonner` follows the theme via `useTheme`.
- **Product imagery** is `ProductIllustration`: a colored icon tile keyed by category name.
  It matches the four hardcoded categories exactly; any other category string (including a
  misspelling in backend data) falls back to a neutral `Package` tile. There are no real
  product images — the backend has no image field.
- `RivePlayer` wraps `@rive-app/react-canvas` and falls back to its `fallback` prop until a
  `.riv` file loads. Nothing renders it yet and `public/` contains no `.riv` files; it is
  referenced only in a comment in `ProductIllustration`.
- `EmptyState` (`components/ui/empty-state.tsx`) is the shared empty-list component (icon,
  title, description, optional action), used by `/orders` and the cart drawer.
- Responsive pattern: `max-w-7xl` (catalog) / `max-w-2xl` (forms, orders) containers with
  `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`, Tailwind breakpoint utilities. Header nav and search hide below
  `md`/`sm`.

## Error Handling

| Case | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Loading | `Skeleton` components; list pages show skeleton grids, `/products` dims the grid at `opacity: 0.6` while `isFetching` |
| Empty | `EmptyState` component: `/orders`, `/products` (with "Clear filters"), the cart drawer, checkout, and a missing product |
| 401 | Interceptor logs out; guarded pages then redirect to `/login` |
| 403 | No specific handling — a non-admin who reaches an admin call sees the generic error message |
| 404 | Product detail renders a "Product not found" `EmptyState` on `isError`; `getInventory` maps 404 → `null`; restock maps 404 → create |
| Load failure | `ErrorState` (`components/ui/error-state.tsx`) with a "Try again" button replaces the content on `/products`, `/orders`, `/orders/[id]` and the admin list. Before this, a failed request looked like an empty list or a never-ending skeleton. |
| Submit errors | `ErrorMessage` (`components/ui/error-message.tsx`, `role="alert"`) beside the control: login, register, checkout, new-product dialog (which also reports a failed initial-stock call: the product exists, stock was not set). |
| Row-level action errors | `toast.error` — restock, where an inline message would have no good place. Successes use `toast.success`. |
| Network failure | No dedicated handling; surfaces as the generic fallback message |
| Validation | Native HTML form validation only (`required`, `type="email"`, `minLength={8}`, `min`/`step`). No schema validation library. |

Unexpected render errors are caught by `app/error.tsx` (header and footer stay; the "Try again" button calls `retry()`, which is this Next.js version's recovery call rather than the older `reset()`). Unknown URLs get `app/not-found.tsx` (HTTP 404). `app/global-error.tsx` covers a failure of the root layout itself; it renders its own document and is always light, because the theme toggle lives in that layout.

## Environment Configuration

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | API gateway base URL | `http://localhost:8000` |

`.env.local.example` documents it. `next.config.ts` is empty (defaults). Because the variable is
`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, it is inlined at build time — a container image must be rebuilt to point at a
different gateway. No Dockerfile exists in this repo.

## Testing

End-to-end tests live in `e2e/` and run with `npm run test:e2e` (config: `playwright.config.ts`,
Chromium only). They run against the **real backend** — start the Docker stack in the
`TaskManager` repo first; the tests do not start it. The config reuses a dev server already on
port 3100, or starts one there; the port is fixed because the gateway's CORS policy allows
`http://localhost:3100` only.

| Test | Covers |
|---|---|
| catalog loads products from the backend | Frontend ↔ gateway wiring: a wrong `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` fails here instead of leaving skeletons forever |
| a new customer can check out and the order is confirmed | Register → add to cart → checkout → saga resolves to `Confirmed`, then asserts stock dropped by one in InventoryService |

The checkout test registers a new `e2e+<id>@example.com` user on each run, and buys one unit of
the first catalog product that has a non-zero price and stock (found via the public
`GET /products` and `GET /inventory`). It skips, rather than fails, when no such product
exists. Each run therefore leaves a test user and an order behind and consumes one unit of
stock — acceptable on a local dev stack, not something to point at shared data.

The tests are not in CI: GitHub Actions has no backend to reach. Running them there would
mean starting the backend stack in the workflow.

## Important Conventions

1. Components call feature hooks; only `features/*/api.ts` imports `apiClient`.
2. DTO types live next to the call that returns them, in `features/*/api.ts`.
3. Auth token is read from the store *inside* the interceptor (`getState()`), never passed in.
4. Guard client pages with `useRequireAuth` and render `null` until `isReady` — never redirect
   before `hasHydrated`.
5. Mutations invalidate query keys in `onSuccess`; no manual cache writes.
6. URL search params are the source of truth for catalog filter/sort/page state.
7. Base UI composition uses `render={...}`, not `asChild`.
8. Error copy comes from `getApiErrorMessage`, never from `error.message`. Where it shows follows the table in Error Handling: page data → `ErrorState`, a submitted form → `ErrorMessage`, a row action → toast.

## Known Issues / Uncertainties

- **Test coverage is thin.** Two end-to-end tests cover catalog loading and the checkout path
  (see Testing); there are no unit or component tests, and CI still verifies only lint + build.
  Most behavior above is read from source, not from test evidence.
- Order pricing is client-supplied: checkout sends `unitPrice` from the local cart.
  Verified in the backend (2026-09-19): `OrderService` does **not** re-validate — it stores the
  client's `unitPrice` verbatim. Tracked in the backend `docs/TODO.md`.
- Prices are formatted with `toFixed(2)` and a hardcoded `$`; there is no currency/locale
  handling.
- Categories are hardcoded (`categories.ts`) and must match backend data exactly. Products
  whose stored category differs (e.g. a typo) never match a category filter and render with
  the fallback illustration.
- `admin` product creation has no rollback if the follow-up inventory call fails.
- Product **editing/deletion** does not exist in the frontend — only create and restock.
- Local `.env.local` can silently drift from `.env.local.example`. A copy left pointing at
  `http://localhost:5160` (the gateway's `dotnet run` port) fails every API call with
  `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` while the Docker stack is up, leaving `/products` on skeletons
  indefinitely. Use `http://localhost:8000` with the Docker gateway.

Verified 2026-09-19 against the running Docker stack: the gateway serves the bare
`GET /products` the catalog page issues, and its CORS policy allows `http://localhost:3100`
with credentials.
